# openatlas-docker

Docker image for [OpenAtlas](https://openatlas.eu/)

Still janky. Absolutely not recommended for production use.

## TODO:
* Make postgres db a service
* Serve app with wsgi
* Set ENVS for passwords etc.

## Use 

- Run dockerfile / docker-compose
- The App is available on the host under the specified port with the standard user 'OpenAtlas' and password 'change_me_PLEASE!'.
